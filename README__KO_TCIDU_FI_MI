This is not done.
It doesn't do lujvo yet.

It's ugly.
It *will* break (and it will do so in the exact moment you read the most
interesting part of whatever you're reading).

And please don't tell me how much I suck, I already know.

in ui.c.

Transcripts
-----------
A transcript contains the list of all the words you've looked up. The idea is
that you know what words to add to your flashcard program (you use one, don't
you?).
Keep in mind that this is a very dumb feature, if you look up the same word
twice, it will be in the transcript twice, so you might want to use "sort -u"
and friends.
